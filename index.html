                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, My name is Richard. This looks somewhat like me! I am a hard-working Full Stack Developer with a
                    slight preference towards the backend as I am not much of a designer. In my spare time I enjoy playing airsoft,
                    watching films and playing video games as well as playing with my dog and taking her for walks. I have had an
                    interest in technology and coding from a young age because of my interest in video games.
                    I am currently doing a coding bootcamp at iO Academy and I am keen to find a position working as a
                    Developer when I finish!</p>

                        <p>This is my first project using react, my team and I were given an
                            API to consume and a wireframe for the front end. I found this project
                            very interesting because it was the first time I had used componant based
                            programming as well as bootstrap.</p>

                    <h2>OOP listing project</h2>
                    <p>This is my OOP listing project, this was my first OOP project. My team and I were
                    given a front end and were tasked with creating an API for it to consume. I enjoyed
                    this project because I find OOP easier to follow than other kinds of programming.</p>

                    because it was also the first big project using php, which I am a big fan of!</p>
