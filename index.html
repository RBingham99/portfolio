                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, My name is Richard. This looks somewhat like me! I am a hard-working Full Stack Developer with a
                    slight preference towards the backend as I am not much of a designer. In my spare time I enjoy playing airsoft,
                    watching films and playing video games as well as playing with my dog and taking her for walks. I have had an
                    interest in technology and coding from a young age because of my interest in video games.
                    I am currently doing a coding bootcamp at iO Academy and I am keen to find a position working as a
                    Developer when I finish!</p>

                        <p>This is my first project using react, my team and I were given an
                            API to consume and a wireframe for the front end. I found this project
                            very interesting because it was the first time I had used component based
                            programming as well as bootstrap.</p>

                    <p>This is my OOP listing project, this was my first OOP project. My team and I were
                    given a front end and were tasked with creating an API for it to consume. I enjoyed
                    this project because I find OOP easier to follow than other kinds of programming. Unfortunately
                    this project hasn't been hosted yet, but I will add a link when it has.</p>

                    <p>This project was the academy portal, it is a site for the staff at the academy to
                        keep track of staff, students, applicants and events. It is a continuous project that is
                        worked on by every class that goes through the academy. All of our class's contributions were
                        bug fixes and added validation. This project was difficult to estimate because even though many
                        of the fixes were simple, a lot of the pre-existing code was a mess, so we spent a lot of time
                        cleaning it up, and making it more efficient. Unfortunately because this is a real application
                        used by the academy I am unable to link to the github repository or the live version.</p>

                    <h2>Showcase project</h2>
                    <p>For this project our class was split into 2 teams and given a selection of projects to
                    choose from, my group chose to make a front end for a restaurant and the other team decided to make
                    the corresponding backend. This project was a lot of fun, because we had to keep in communication
                    with the other team as well as the usual communication within our team, at times this was difficult
                    because the other team went remote for a few days because of illness and train strikes. However,
                    I am very happy with the project we managed to deliver in the end. Unfortunately there is no live
                    site at the moment, but I will have it up as soon as possible.</p>
